	<p>Welcome Karthik, this is your first tutorial on the git hub and you are doing well when you reached untill this end. That is very good sign that you are learning well.</p>
	<p>Hello this is the testing from the git hub installer on mac. </p>
	<p>Now I understood the change, if you change the files from the other source like the text editor or else from the eclipse you will see only the current changes in the folder that you gave it as the repository for the Git hub.</p>
	<p>Today I installed this on my windows desktop and then was trying to see whether this works fine for me.</p>
